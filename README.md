Tracking FreeCAD localization and progress

### Contribute

**Important Note**: in order to maintain accuracy we ask that users install and run the most cutting edge development version of FreeCAD. This can be achieved in 2 ways:

1. Installing the latest pre-built development snapshots at https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-Bundle/releases/tag/weekly-builds
2. Compiling FreeCAD yourself

Then create an account on the crowdsourced translation site we utilize on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/freecad)


#### Missing translations

If you're running the latest development snapshot and have found a missing translation for you language or a section of the UI isn't translated, please double-check [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/freecad) to confirm. If so, then please open a [ticket](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD-translations/issues) so we can track the issue.

#### Incorrect translations

Please use Crowdin to create an issue to discuss this with the language team. A proofreader or a manager will be able to change the translation. So please find out who those users are.

#### Translations are not in FreeCAD

Every so often we push new strings thast require translation in to Crowdin and pull translation back in to FreeCAD. Sometimes there is a window of time where we haven't done this. In this case translations won't go 'live' until we do this. Please be patient.

### Testing

There is an option to test translations yourself. This section will be exapnded upon soon.
