# 		QM file converter for FreeCAD translators
# This script was written for the international community engaged in the work of translating and improving FreeCAD GUI translations
# In the first edition, this work was done by a long command with pipelined processing. However, when more people of different nationalities started to use this solution modifying the command could be cumbersome.
# Therefore, this all-purpose versatile bash script was created to solve several inconveniences, at the same time as it recognizes the language of the source files.
